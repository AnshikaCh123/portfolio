        <P>My name is Anshika Chaurasia.I am persuing BCA from PSIT college of higher education kanpur.
        I completed my 10 and 12th from Saraswati vidya mandir college school kanpur.Coming to my
        strength i am innovative type of person,good at multi-tasking and hardworking and my weakenss 
        is that i feel difficulty sometimes to saying no to people.and being too much sensitive sometimes.
        I specialize in turning design concepts into interactive and responsive websites using the latest 
        frontend technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.I strive to create seamless user experiences
        that leave a lasting impression.I believe in open communication and collaboration throughout the development
        process. Your vision is my priority, and I'm committed to working closely with you to bring it to life,
        every step of the way.
